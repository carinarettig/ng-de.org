Organising a conference in the times of the pandemic is not easy. 
We have gathered best practices from other conferences and have studied the official regulation in Berlin. We have retrospected and tried to predict the future. We want to provide maximum safety and fun.

The results of our collective brainstorming is documented in our [COVID guidelines](/covid). Check it out!

If you have any other questions, please contact us directly!

Best regards

Martina, Toni, Joe, Maria, Carina, David and Robin
