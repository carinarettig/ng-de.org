we are happy to announce that we are back, busy planning the next NG-DE Conference for you in September 2022!
And we have even more news for you: We bring you one more conference day on top of the
NG-DE conference days In cooperation with VueJS.DE! The additional day is a new conference called DotVue and will be also for the community, by the community!

But how did we get there? Organizing a conference next to all our normal jobs can be stressful, that's why we decided to expand our team. We want to be able to bring you the best conference we can aim for. Since two of our members are very involved in the VueJS community, we came to the idea to give VueJS also a place to be. That's how DotVue got born. So let's give them a warm community welcome and our support <3
