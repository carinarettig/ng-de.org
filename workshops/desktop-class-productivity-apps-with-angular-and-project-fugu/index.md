  In his hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to implement desktop-class productivity apps using the new Project Fugu web APIs. 
  This joint project between Google, Intel, Microsoft, and others seeks to bring missing features to the web, including access to the local file system, clipboard, and registering Angular apps as default file handlers.
