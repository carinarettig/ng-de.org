title: Angular Architecture Workshop - From Moduliths to Micro Frontends - Workshop with Manfred Steyer - NG-DE 2022 - Angular Conference - Berlin
description: >
  In this interactive workshop you will learn from Manfred Steyer - Angular GDE and Trusted Collaborator in the Angular team - how large and scalable enterprise applications can be developed with Angular.
  To do this, we first consider the use of Strategic Domain Design to create a front-end Modulith (modular monolith). We use the popular Nx and Monorepos for the implementation. We look at approaches to enforce your architecture. Also, we use incremental builds and the build cache to speed up builds and test runs dramatically.
  These ideas are gradually being expanded into a Micro Frontend Architecture. The brand new webpack 5 module federation, which is considered a missing link for such architectures, is used for this purpose. Apart from the "good weather scenarios", we also consider further concepts, such as dealing with version conflicts, dynamic federation or the combination of different frameworks and versions.
  After the individual exercises you will have a case study that you can use as a template for your own projects. In the end, you will not only know how to implement Micro Frontends with the latest technology, but also whether this architectural style suits you and what alternatives you have. You will also be able to evaluate the individual options against the background of your plans.
