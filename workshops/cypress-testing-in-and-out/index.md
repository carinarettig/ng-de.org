title: Cypress in and out - testing all the things - Workshop with Tobias Struckmeier - NG-DE 2022 - Angular Conference - Berlin
description: >
  We will briefly review some basic principles and patterns that can be used to counter unstable tests and which problems can even be traced back to shortcomings of the application.

  As cypress allows extensive request handling we will introduce into testing and mocking of requests.
  Building on this knowledge we explain how to implement API testing with cypress.

  Finally tests over multiple domains in cypress are possible. So we dive into cypress approach discuss the challenges.

  We give some suggestions on how to structure and organize your tests in order to retain your overview even in larger projects.

  How do I test if my application also looks correctly? We cover this with Visual Regression Test and show how a free platform can simplify the handling.

  Finally for component and library developers we explain component testing.

  The steps to get Cypress into an automatic build pipeline are essential and therefore last part of our workshop.
