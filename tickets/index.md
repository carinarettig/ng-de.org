## For the community, by the community

NG-DE is the first community-driven angular conference in Germany. We partner together with the [VueJS.DE Community Conference](https://conf.vuejs.de) that will happen just one day before NG-DE. 

Both frameworks have a huge community focus and similar concepts so we provide a platform for these together. You are able to buy a combo ticket at a reduced price.

The venue BOLLE FESTSÃ„LE is located next to the beautiful Spree river, close to Bellevue palace and Tiergarten. A bunch of one-day workshops are planned which can be booked separately from the main event.

By buying a ticket you accept the code of conduct.
