## Call for Papers

### The Selection Process

For the selection of talks we will follow the jsconf.eu process. That means:

- All submissions will be anonymized, so that there is no bias towards the submitter.
- All submissions will be reviewed and voted on by the jury.
- The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details into account.

### If your talk gets selected

- We will cover your travel and accommodation (two nights) costs for the conference.
- The conference ticket is included for both days.
- We will add your talk, bio and Twitter handle on the website and promote you via our social media accounts before, during and after the conference.
- Your talk will be recorded and published on our YouTube channel after the conference.
- There will be a guided walking tour through Berlin on Sunday 23th August, please book your travel according to it if you like to join :)

### The Jury

Will be announced shortly



We're looking forward to your submissions!
