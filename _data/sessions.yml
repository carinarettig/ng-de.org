  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - Nx, Micro Frontends, and Signal Store
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop, we utilize the latest Angular features to implement a modern and maintainable architecture. We start with Standalone Components and discuss approaches to modularization without NgModules, such as monorepos, Nx, and Sheriff. 

    Then, we explore the potential of Micro Frontends. We discuss when they make sense and how to implement them using web standards, the Angular CLIâ€™s new esbuild support, and Module Federation or Native Federation. 

    We proceed with Signals, local change detection, and Zone-less Angular. Subsequently, we integrate the new Signal Store to establish modern and lightweight state management. Thanks to its custom features, we can use the Signal Store to implement recurring, complex requirements with just a few lines of code. 

    By the end, you'll be equipped to design modern and maintainable Angular solutions.

  title: Community === You
  description: >
    We hear about it, we talk about it and we're a part of it: The Community - it's more than just a buzzword. 
    The developer community at large is an incredible place, and many people have benefited from being part of it. But do you really know the value of being part of a community group and how it can help you? Whether you want to participate in an existing community group, build your own or just want to learn more, this talk will go in-depth about the developer community. Weâ€™ll dive into what the community is, how you can be a part of it and how it can help you grow. Iâ€™ll also share some personal learnings and findings that I have discovered on my journey to building and being a part of various community groups.

  title: Understanding The Iterable Differs
  description: >
    Have you ever wondered how Angular works so fast? 
    Most of us use built-in directives like ngFor, ngClass, ngStyle, and more on daily basis, and get an enormous fast result. 
    The secret behind all these fast utils is an Angular Abstraction most of us not really familiar with.  
    In this talk, we will explain what the differs are and how the framework uses them internally.
