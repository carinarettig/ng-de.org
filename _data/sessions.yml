  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - From Moduliths to Micro Frontends
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop you will learn from Manfred Steyer - Angular GDE and Trusted Collaborator in the Angular team - how large and scalable enterprise applications can be developed with Angular.

    To do this, we first consider the use of Strategic Domain Design to create a front-end Modulith (modular monolith). We use the popular Nx and Monorepos for the implementation. We look at approaches to enforce your architecture. 
    
    Also, we use incremental builds and the build cache to speed up builds and test runs dramatically.

    Master global and component state and optimize template logic.
    If you already know REDUX or reactive state management patterns and want to learn more advanced things about the architecture-related components, this is the workshop you need to book.

    Local component state, flattening operators, contextual state and its display component templates, performance for component bindings and advanced custom operators – this workshop will provide a solid foundation from which you can continue to develop these and many more advanced skills pushing your knowledge to the next level.


    We will learn:
    - Local vs. global state (when to use what)
    - Derived state (shared computations, distinct changes, and nullish values)
    - Model vs. ViewModel
    - OOP Design Patterns for Component state (Facade, MVVM/Presenter, MVC, Adapter)
    - Subscription-less architecture
    - Optimize data fetching with RxJS flattening operators
    - How to handle error, complete, suspense, and values in the template
    - Reactive Component lazy loading
    - Improving UX with Reusable reactive helpers
    - Resilient error handling
    - Advanced custom operators
    - Performant component bindings

    Chris is a GDE for Angular and web capabilities. 
    In his hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to implement desktop-class productivity apps using the new Project Fugu web APIs. 
    This joint project between Google, Intel, Microsoft, and others seeks to bring missing features to the web, including access to the local file system, clipboard, and registering Angular apps as default file handlers. 
    Learn how you can finally bring productivity apps like IDEs, image editors, or office apps to the web!
    You also need to bring your own laptop to this workshop.

  title: Handling state in Angular applications - NgRx Store and ComponentStore
  logo: ngrx.svg
  description: >
    NgRx is the most popular state management library for Angular apps. It's widely used, well supported and maintained.

    Now NgRx has two distinct and independent libraries for state management - Store and ComponentStore. We’ll start by learning WHY and HOW to use the Store properly and WHERE it can help, after that we’ll cover ComponentStore, its use cases and differences from the Store.

    Who is this workshop for? Whether you have never used NgRx before or were using it for a while - you'll learn something new during this training. Intermediate and advanced Angular developers will benefit the most from this workshop.

  title: Community === You
  description: >
    We hear about it, we talk about it and we're a part of it: The Community - it's more than just a buzzword. 
    The developer community at large is an incredible place, and many people have benefited from being part of it. But do you really know the value of being part of a community group and how it can help you? Whether you want to participate in an existing community group, build your own or just want to learn more, this talk will go in-depth about the developer community. We’ll dive into what the community is, how you can be a part of it and how it can help you grow. I’ll also share some personal learnings and findings that I have discovered on my journey to building and being a part of various community groups.
