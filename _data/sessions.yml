  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - From Moduliths to Micro Frontends
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop you will learn from Manfred Steyer - Angular GDE and Trusted Collaborator in the Angular team - how large and scalable enterprise applications can be developed with Angular.

    To do this, we first consider the use of Strategic Domain Design to create a front-end Modulith (modular monolith). We use the popular Nx and Monorepos for the implementation. We look at approaches to enforce your architecture. 
    
    Also, we use incremental builds and the build cache to speed up builds and test runs dramatically.

  description: >
   We will briefly review some basic principles and patterns that can be used to counter unstable tests and which problems can even be traced back to shortcomings of the application.

    As cypress allows extensive request handling we will introduce into testing and mocking of requests.
    Building on this knowledge we explain how to implement API testing with cypress.

    Finally tests over multiple domains in cypress are possible. So we dive into cypress approach discuss the challenges.

    We give some suggestions on how to structure and organize your tests in order to retain your overview even in larger projects.

    How do I test if my application also looks correctly? We cover this with Visual Regression Test and show how a free platform can simplify the handling.

    Finally for component and library developers we explain component testing.

    The steps to get Cypress into an automatic build pipeline are essential and therefore last part of our workshop.

  title: Handling state in Angular applications - NgRx Store and ComponentStore
  logo: ngrx.svg
  description: >
    NgRx is the most popular state management library for Angular apps. It's widely used, well supported and maintained.

    Now NgRx has two distinct and independent libraries for state management - Store and ComponentStore. We’ll start by learning WHY and HOW to use the Store properly and WHERE it can help, after that we’ll cover ComponentStore, its use cases and differences from the Store.

    Who is this workshop for? Whether you have never used NgRx before or were using it for a while - you'll learn something new during this training. Intermediate and advanced Angular developers will benefit the most from this workshop.

    We hear about it, we talk about it and we're a part of it: The Community - it's more than just a buzzword. 
    The developer community at large is an incredible place, and many people have benefited from being part of it. But do you really know the value of being part of a community group and how it can help you? Whether you want to participate in an existing community group, build your own or just want to learn more, this talk will go in-depth about the developer community. We’ll dive into what the community is, how you can be a part of it and how it can help you grow. I’ll also share some personal learnings and findings that I have discovered on my journey to building and being a part of various community groups.

    Have you ever wondered how Angular works so fast? 
    Most of us use built-in directives like ngFor, ngClass, ngStyle, and more on daily basis, and get an enormous fast result. 
    The secret behind all these fast utils is an Angular Abstraction most of us not really familiar with.  
    In this talk, we will explain what the differs are and how the framework uses them internally.

  description: >
    Module Federation is often mentioned in the same breath as Micro Frontends. 
    However, this innovative technology has so much more to offer. 
    That is why we look at three different scenarios beyond Micro Frontends: 
    Plugin-based systems that use extensions provided via an app store, A/B testing, and the drastic acceleration of your build times.  
    By the end, you will know how to use these possibilities in your applications.

  title: Securing Angular with Trusted Types
  description: >
    Cross-Site Scripting is game over! We've been hearing this for a while now. 
    Unfortunately, it is still more than relevant in the world of Angular-based frontends.
    While Angular offers great protections out-of-the-box, I’ve witnessed first-hand how even a little room for mistakes can still result in XSS vulnerabilities.   
    No more. In this session, we look at Trusted Types, a platform-based defense that will eradicate XSS vulnerabilities in frontends. 
    We investigate how Trusted Types can stop typical frontend XSS attacks. 
    Additionally, we explore how to enable Trusted Types in Angular to protect your entire application. 
    You will walk away with actionable advice to get started with Trusted Types.

  description: >
    In the fast but yet peaceful county of Jest, Mr. Button went missing but here comes Detective DOMinic Printer. 
    The investigation begins and questions start raining: Was the change detection triggered? 
    Is it just the wrong selector? Isn't Mr. Button working in browser-land? 
    By the way, didn't we introduce a visual regression? 
    While end-to-end testing with Cypress sounds like the natural alternative, it comes with other challenges related to the size of the investigation area.  
    Join us on this case, where we will see how Cypress Component Testing bridges the gap between both worlds and helps us narrow the investigation to instantly solve the mystery of the missing Mr. Button.

  title: Perceived faster Angular applications
  description: >
    Angular is a powerful all-in-one JavaScript Framework and therefore a common choice for Enterprise applications. 
    But many developers complain that Angular is too slow compared to more lightweight UI-only Frameworks even though Ivy has improved performance significantly.
    Insights into the bootstrapping process of an Angular application will provide you some ideas how to load data or configuration upfront. 
    Usability improvements using shimmer animations or parallel backend requests can mask slow data fetching and allow you to reduce the perceived waiting time for website users. 
    Tips and tricks for loading animations and caching strategies will be explained.
