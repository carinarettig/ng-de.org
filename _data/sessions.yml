  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - From Moduliths to Micro Frontends
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop you will learn from Manfred Steyer - Angular GDE and Trusted Collaborator in the Angular team - how large and scalable enterprise applications can be developed with Angular.

    To do this, we first consider the use of Strategic Domain Design to create a front-end Modulith (modular monolith). We use the popular Nx and Monorepos for the implementation. We look at approaches to enforce your architecture. 
    
    Also, we use incremental builds and the build cache to speed up builds and test runs dramatically.

    Master global and component state and optimize template logic.
    If you already know REDUX or reactive state management patterns and want to learn more advanced things about the architecture-related components, this is the workshop you need to book.

    Local component state, flattening operators, contextual state and its display component templates, performance for component bindings and advanced custom operators – this workshop will provide a solid foundation from which you can continue to develop these and many more advanced skills pushing your knowledge to the next level.


    We will learn:
    - Local vs. global state (when to use what)
    - Derived state (shared computations, distinct changes, and nullish values)
    - Model vs. ViewModel
    - OOP Design Patterns for Component state (Facade, MVVM/Presenter, MVC, Adapter)
    - Subscription-less architecture
    - Optimize data fetching with RxJS flattening operators
    - How to handle error, complete, suspense, and values in the template
    - Reactive Component lazy loading
    - Improving UX with Reusable reactive helpers
    - Resilient error handling
    - Advanced custom operators
    - Performant component bindings

  title: Creating A More Sustainable Development Team with Angular and the PAMstack
  description: >
    In this talk we'll discuss the ideas around how to create an sustainable architecture for your team through the PAMstack, a new framework for creating inclusive development teams. We'll talk about some of the abstractions and tools that Angular has to enable the longevity and success of your teams to support junior developers, designers, project managers, and more. No application is too critical, complicated, or obscure to be able to achieve this. 
      
    We will also talk through how you can build a corresponding culture that allows inclusivity on your team, and why this is so critical to your business. We'll walk through processes you can incorporate, team roles, and how you can build a better template for the future.

  title: The Myth of the Brilliant Developer
  description: >
    "I walk into a large white room. It's a dance studio in midtown Manhattan. I'm wearing a sweatshirt, faded jeans, and Nike cross-trainers. The room is lined with eight-foot-high mirrors. There's a boom box in the corner. The floor is clean, virtually spotless if you don't count the thousands of skid marks and footprints left there by dancers rehearsing. Other than the mirrors, the boom box, the skid marks, and me, the room is empty.  
      
    To some people, this empty room symbolizes something profound, mysterious, and terrifying: the task of starting with nothing and working your way toward creating something whole and beautiful and satisfying.  
      
    Some people find this moment—the moment before creativity begins—so painful that they simply cannot deal with it. In its most extreme form, this terror totally paralyzes people.  
      
    The blank space can be humbling. But I've faced it my whole professional life. It's my job. It's also my calling. Bottom line: Filling this empty space constitutes my identity."
      
          Twyla Tharp in “The Creative Habit
      
    This talk stems from a personal question both Carmen and Martin share, but is deeply rooted in the work of dr. Carol S. Dweck and choreographer Twyla Tharp. Just as with their research and practices, our talk starts by questioning what “natural talent” really means or whether such a thing exists at all, and goes on to analyse how this belief manifests itself and can influence our careers as developers. By tackling this subject, our wish is to open up the discussion about our self-image as developers and about what we as a community can do to create a healthy and empowering environment for everyone.

    "Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?" - Avril Lavigne, implementing Angular forms in 2019  
      
    Forms are such a basic part of web applications; how did they get so complicated? This talk will walk through Angular template driven vs. reactive forms and use cases for their implementation, basic & more complex form-validation, custom component implementations like typeahead and date-pickers, and finally use of the little-known Control Value Accessor interface to solve almost any form problem. This talk will also include some useful workarounds for those more complex PITA requirements that always seem to pop up in projects.

    Imagine an astronaut using your Angular application in space. Accessibility is about providing the best user experience that leads to software made with people in difficult situations in mind. Such difficulties might be temporal, permanent or caused by the environment... like Space.  
      
    I’ll prepare your app for use in the pitch black of space and brightest of sunlight. I’ll implement navigation with voice commands, use a keyboard and touch-screen with gloves. I will show you how to produce accessible software that is ready-to-use even on a spaceship.

  title: Subjecting State to Good Behavior
  description: >
    Apps of all sizes need to manage state, but not all apps need a state machine like NgRx. What if we can't afford the code cost and indirection? What if we don't want to decouple our business layer? There's more to Angular state management than just getters and setters or a global stream. Let's set up readable, uncomplicated state management using behavior subjects, observables, and immutability — all OnPush ready. In this talk, we'll explore scaling up state management in Angular from extremely simple to more robust, and come away with knowledge that will help us gain a better understanding of Angular, RxJS, and even third party state management libraries.

    Angular Material AND Bootstrap for your next Angular application? It doesn't make sense, does it? The first time I talked to my colleagues about combining the two, they laughed at me. But now, they love the approach because it works like a charm.  
    In this session, we will see how we can leverage the best parts of both libraries to build beautiful, maintainable, and responsive Angular applications with very little CSS.

    The web is evolving, we got it. One of the clear consequences is the complexity of our web apps (formerly known as ‘websites’). The conciseness of functional programming and its fundamentals got our attention, but we knew we could do better. And now we have the Reactive programming model, a functional and declarative way of dealing with big amounts of data.  
      
    In the center of it we have Observables: objects responsible to keep your application alive, reacting to any mutation your data may have, through any period of time. We'll take a look on the concepts and also on the lib that implements it in Angular's core: RxJS. Using the provided operators, we have great power on our hands, doing anything imaginable in a concise, declarative and easy-to-maintain way.  
      
    Watch out: observables are here to stay!

  description: >
    Application scalability is a two sided coin: it has to scale with both your user-base and your team size. But when you need to start a project, you don't know how big will it become -- it could go from “small” all the way to “Google-sized”. With so many variables to consider, how do you evaluate if Angular is the right solution? What challenges will you face along the way as your team and project grow?  
      
    This is the tale of how we went from nothing to a worldwide distributed platform, to a team 10 times bigger, from low traffic to 2M visits per day, and all the challenges we faced. And most important of all: how we set the whole thing up in 14 days.

  title: "Add Native Mobile to Your Angular Projects: The Migration Story"
  description: >
    The Angular and NativeScript teams teamed up to create a new way to share your code between web and mobile apps with Angular and NativeScript. It allows you to easily share the business logic of your app, while providing you an intuitive way to separate the code that is different between the platforms.  
      
    The ability to share code between your Angular web app and Native mobile apps has never been easier (or more important). Who has the time to invest resources into separate apps for web, native iOS, and native Android?  
      
    In this talk you will learn how to take an existing Angular Web project and add NativeScript to it, by converting it to a code-sharing project. Then we will go through a few steps of converting individual components and modules into a code-sharing structure.

    Tooling for code generation, transformation and interrogation has improved in leaps and bounds over the last few years! We now have things like Angular Schematics, Prettier and TSLint, that can manipulate code in powerful ways, speed up development, and provide insight into how our applications work. But how exactly do they work? This talk will be Code Tooling 101, and act as an introduction to Abstract Syntax Trees, and all the weird and wonderful things you can do with them. By the end of the talk, attendants should have an idea of how ASTs work, how they are used in code tooling, and how they can be used to manipulate and interrogate code at a structural level!

    Dependency Injection framework is a core and inherent feature of both Nest and Angular. DI simplifies creating scalable, testable, and maintainable applications by giving us flexible and efficient abstractions. However, did we ever think how this mechanism works underneath? In this talk, we’ll compare how Nest and Angular DI systems differ from each other as well as dive into the basics of the metadata reflection API in TypeScript.

    Reusable components are a great idea. That is, until you find yourself working in a React app and you’re unable to reuse the great Angular components you’ve already built. Thankfully, there’s a way around this. If you need to support multiple frontend frameworks, you can harness the power of Angular Elements to do just that and build reusable shared components that will drop right in your app. In this talk, we’ll show you how you can manage components across different frontend frameworks and keep everyone happy.

    Zones? Injectors? Modules? Haven't you always wanted to create just 1 simple component without being worried about those massive buzzwords? Now you can finally get it!  
      
    Angular is changing, and with the upcoming release of Ivy, it becomes much leaner and dynamic than before.  
    In this talk, I will demonstrate why Angular Ivy is truly a game changer. We will understand how we can leverage the Ivy renderer to create independent components, without zones, and without the need of modules. We will learn how to import non-routable components dynamically and even to create higher order components decorators!
