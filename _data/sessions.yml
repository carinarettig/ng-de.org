  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - From Moduliths to Micro Frontends
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop you will learn from Manfred Steyer - Angular GDE and Trusted Collaborator in the Angular team - how large and scalable enterprise applications can be developed with Angular.

    To do this, we first consider the use of Strategic Domain Design to create a front-end Modulith (modular monolith). We use the popular Nx and Monorepos for the implementation. We look at approaches to enforce your architecture. 
    
    Also, we use incremental builds and the build cache to speed up builds and test runs dramatically.

    Master global and component state and optimize template logic.
    If you already know REDUX or reactive state management patterns and want to learn more advanced things about the architecture-related components, this is the workshop you need to book.

    Local component state, flattening operators, contextual state and its display component templates, performance for component bindings and advanced custom operators – this workshop will provide a solid foundation from which you can continue to develop these and many more advanced skills pushing your knowledge to the next level.


    We will learn:
    - Local vs. global state (when to use what)
    - Derived state (shared computations, distinct changes, and nullish values)
    - Model vs. ViewModel
    - OOP Design Patterns for Component state (Facade, MVVM/Presenter, MVC, Adapter)
    - Subscription-less architecture
    - Optimize data fetching with RxJS flattening operators
    - How to handle error, complete, suspense, and values in the template
    - Reactive Component lazy loading
    - Improving UX with Reusable reactive helpers
    - Resilient error handling
    - Advanced custom operators
    - Performant component bindings

    Chris is a GDE for Angular and web capabilities. 
    In his hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to implement desktop-class productivity apps using the new Project Fugu web APIs. 
    This joint project between Google, Intel, Microsoft, and others seeks to bring missing features to the web, including access to the local file system, clipboard, and registering Angular apps as default file handlers. 
    Learn how you can finally bring productivity apps like IDEs, image editors, or office apps to the web!
    You also need to bring your own laptop to this workshop.
